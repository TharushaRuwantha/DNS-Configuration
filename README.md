  <h2>What is DNS</h2>
  DNS stands for Domain Name System, and a DNS server is a computer server that contains a database of IP addresses and domain names. When you type a domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS server to look up the IP address associated with that domain name. The DNS server then returns the IP address to your computer, allowing it to connect to the website you requested.

In simpler terms, DNS servers are like the phone book of the internet. They translate human-friendly domain names, such as www.example.com, into machine-friendly IP addresses, such as 192.168.1.1, that are used to identify web servers and other network resources. Without DNS servers, we would have to remember and enter long strings of numbers to access websites and other online services.
